LAB 3

Create a java program that performs the following operation:<br>
The program should collect an integer array from the user<br>
After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items<br>
Find the Mean Value<br>
Find the Median Value<br>
Find the Mode Value<br>
From the user-given array.<br>
The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.<br>

Process

The program starts by asking the user to input the number of elements they want to enter in the array.<br>
The program then creates an integer array of the size entered by the user and fills it with integer values entered by the user.<br>
The program then asks the user to choose between three options - mean, median, and mode.<br>
Depending on the user's choice, the program calls one of three methods - Mean, Median, or Mode.<br>
The Mean method calculates the mean (average) of the values in the array and returns the result.<br>
The Median method sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the median (middle value) of the values in the array and returns the result.<br>
The Mode method finds the mode (the value that appears most frequently) of the values in the array and returns the result.<br>
The program then prints the result to the console based on the user's choice.<br>
